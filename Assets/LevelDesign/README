TO CREATE A NEW LEVEL

- First build the level, keeping all gameobjects under a single gameobject with a 'Level' script attached.
- Every new level needs an empty gameobject called 'PlayerStart' to indicate where the player will start.
- Once finished, save the root object as a prefab.
- Add the new prefab to the list of level prefabs in the LevelManager.
- The level can now be loaded by index
